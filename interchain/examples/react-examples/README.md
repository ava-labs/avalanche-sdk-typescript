# ReactJS Examples

We have also included few examples to integrate the `interchain` SDK with frontend libraries like ReactJS.
Run the following commands to setup the React example repository. See examples [here](./examples/react-examples/)

```bash
cd examples/react-examples
npm install
npm run dev
```
