   ```

4. Build the package:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

### Package Structure

- **client/** - Core Avalanche client SDK

- **devtools/** - Development tools (contains generated code)
- **sdk/** - Main SDK package combining client and devtools
- **interchain/** - Interchain messaging SDK
- **metrics/** - Metrics SDK (contains generated code)
- **webhooks/** - Webhooks SDK (contains generated code)

**Note:** Some packages contain generated code. For these packages, we do not accept direct changes to the generated files. Instead, please report issues and we'll address them in the upstream source.

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add TSDoc comments for public APIs/Methods
- Keep functions small and focused
